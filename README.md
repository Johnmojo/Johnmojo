# Hi, I'm Johnny 👋🧑‍💻

I'm a self-taught Front-End developer with a passion for design, interaction & problem-solving. I mostly work on the intersection of digital design especially projects that span different or unique mediums.

As someone with a non-traditional background, I approach problems like a designer with knowledge from my previous field. I like to see myself as a bridge between designers and developers. Someone who understands both sides' language and translates practicality and constraint.

# Tools & Languages used ⚙️ : 

- HTML & SCSS, Javascript, Typescript, PHP
- React.js, Express.js, Next.js, Bootstrap, WordPress
- Adobe Creative Cloud, Autodesk Maya, Blender, Unity, Figma, Git
